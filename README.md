I share the code because many people start asking why it wasent working

Why i didn't update it? because UR Oficial said that in a future they will make an app for pebble so I stop working on this, but it seems they didn't do nothing.


### Code:
* Uses PebbleKitJS from Pebble SDK 2.0
* Built with cloudpebble.net
* Last updated 1/07/2017
