I share the code because many people start asking why it wasent working and currenlty dont have time to continue working on this.

Why i didn't update it? because UR Oficial said that in a future they will make an app for pebble so I stop working on this, but it seems they didn't do nothing.

I have Google Play account if someone continues the work and want to use my account i could share it somehow or if you want to upload in your account rembmeber to add me in the descripction like "Base on the work from 'person name', link "


### Code:
